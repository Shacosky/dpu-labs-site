You are working on the official website of a technology company called DPU Labs SpA.

Context:
DPU Labs delivers multiple types of projects, mainly focused on:
- Cybersecurity (defensive, preventive, monitoring)
- CCTV & physical security systems (condominiums, companies, communities)
- Software development and automation

- Infrastructure, monitoring and integrations

Goal:
Create a clean, scalable structure for a “Projects / Services” section that can support multiple project types without hardcoding specifics.

Requirements:

- Each project/service must have:
  - Title
  - Short value proposition
  - Key features (bullet points)
  - Typical use cases
  - Call to action (contact / quote)
- Must be suitable for a professional tech company (no marketing fluff).
- Tone: serious, clear, enterprise-ready.
- Optimized for future growth (more services will be added).

If coding:
- Prefer React / Next.js style components.
- Use semantic HTML.
- Keep styling abstract (Tailwind-friendly).
- No mock data overload, use placeholders where needed.

If writing content:
- Keep text concise and professional.
- Focus on clarity, trust, and capability.

Deliver:
- Suggested folder/component structure
- Example component or section
- Example content for:
  - Cybersecurity
  - CCTV / Physical Security
