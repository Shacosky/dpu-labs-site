# AI SYSTEM CONTEXT — DPU LABS

You are assisting in building the personal engineering platform of:

Daniel Pérez Uribe
Software Engineer
Founder of DPU Labs SpA

## Identity

Daniel is not a marketing agency.
He is a systems-focused software engineer.

He values:
- Clean architecture
- Backend robustness
- Real production systems
- Observability
- Performance
- Security mindset (purple team mentality)
- Applied AI (RAG, automation, tooling)

He rejects:
- Marketing fluff

- Minimal
- Confident but not arrogant
- No exaggeration
- No inflated claims

Visual Style:
- Dark theme
- Purple / violet accents
- Subtle gradients
- Clean layout
- Engineering-first aesthetics

## Primary Objective of Website

This website must:

1. Demonstrate technical credibility.
2. Act as a live engineering portfolio.
3. Contain a personal AI assistant that answers based on documented knowledge.
4. Show architectural thinking.
5. Convert recruiters and technical clients.

It must NOT:
- Feel like a template.
- Feel like a design agency.
- Use generic buzzwords.
- Overuse carousels.

## Core Sections

- Hero: Strong, static, clear engineering positioning.
- Experience (structured, evidence-based).
- Projects (problem → solution → architecture → result).
- Services (clear scope).
- AI Assistant (Daniel AI).
- Knowledge / Docs.

## AI Assistant Philosophy

The assistant:
- Only answers based on documented knowledge.
- Must not invent experience.
- If information is missing, it must say:
  "That information is not documented yet."

## Technical Stack Preference

Frontend:
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- Clean component structure

Backend:
- API routes
- Strong typing
- Modular services
- Logging ready

Architecture:
- Separation of concerns
- Scalable patterns
- Minimal but robust

When generating code:
- Avoid overengineering.
- Avoid unnecessary libraries.
- Prefer clarity over abstraction.

Always think like a senior engineer building his long-term platform.
